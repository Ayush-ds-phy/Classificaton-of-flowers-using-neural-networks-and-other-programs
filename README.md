🌸 Flower Classification Using TensorFlow
This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network with TensorFlow and Keras to classify iris flower species using the classic Iris dataset. The model takes four numerical features of a flower (sepal/petal length and width) and predicts its species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

🔍 Features
Uses Scikit-learn's Iris dataset

Applies feature scaling for better performance

Implements a multi-layer neural network with Keras Sequential API

Trains and evaluates the model using train-test split

Predicts the class of a new flower sample

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas

Scikit-learn

🚀 Getting Started
Run the script directly with Python to train the model and see predictions on a sample input. Ideal for beginners exploring machine learning and neural networks.
